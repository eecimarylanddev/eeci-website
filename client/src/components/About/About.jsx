          Emmanuel Evangelical Church International (EECI) is a vibrant,
          multi-generational church with a passion for Jesus, people, and our city.
          We are a community of believers dedicated to sharing the gospel
          and love of Christ. Our services are filled with heartfelt worship,
          practical teaching from the Bible, and a welcoming atmosphere
          for all. We believe in building strong families and a strong 
          community, and we offer various ministries for all ages to get
          connected and grow in their faith. Come as you are and experience
          the warmth of our church family.
